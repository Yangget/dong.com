Command Line Manager
====================

Since version 1.3.0 F.A.B. has a command line manager, you can use it for many development tasks.

Many of the commands are designed to import **AppBuilder** class initialized by your application.
By default it will assume your application follows the skeleton structure, so it will try to import
appbuilder from *app/__init__.py*. You can pass your own info to where appbuilder is being initialized.

Take a quick look to the current possibilities. The bold ones require to import your appbuilder.

  - babel-compile - Babel, Compiles all translations

  - babel-extract - Babel, Extracts and updates all messages.

  - **create-admin** - Creates an admin user

  - **create-user** - Create user with arbitrary role

  - create-app - Create a Skeleton application (SQLAlchemy or MongoEngine).

  - create-addon - Create a Skeleton AddOn.

  - **create-db** - Create all your database objects (SQLAlchemy only)

  - **collect-static** - Copies static files from flask-appbuilder to your static folder. Nice to have on certain deploys

    $ fabmanager create-app --help
    Usage: fabmanager create-app [OPTIONS]

    Options:

For example:

    fabmanager babel-extract --target flask_appbuilder/translations/ -k _ -k __

**create-app** - Create new Applications

**--appbuilder** switches to identify how to import **appbuilder**.

This admin user can be used to any type of authentication method configured, but *fabmanager* will not checkit so
it will allways ask for a password (assumes AUTH_DB).
